# Scholar Icons
Scholar Icons is a specialized font icon set for websites of scholars. 


## Motivation
This is created to add icons that is not commonly found on the Font Awesome icons. Thus, this is an extension of Font Awesome since it uses:
- Similar SVG icon grid ```20x16```.
- Similar CCS classes ```si``` ```si-brand``` ```si-2x```.
- Similar license.

I hoped to add more brand and non-brand icons specific to academia.

npm i scholar-icons
